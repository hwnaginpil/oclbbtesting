## OCLBBTesting ##

OCLBBTesting is a tool for the generation of test models for model transformation testing.

The tool follows a black-box approach that exploits the presence of OCL invariants in the model transformation's input metamodel to identify regions in its instance space that must be covered by the test models.

Once these regions have been identified, up to three different generation modes can be used, depending on the effort the tester wants to invest to ensure the absence of overlapping test models.

  1. Single Generation Mode
  1. Multiple-Partition Generation Mode
  1. Unique-Partition Generation Mode

OCLBBTesting requires the presence of [EMFtoCSP](http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/emftocsp/)
